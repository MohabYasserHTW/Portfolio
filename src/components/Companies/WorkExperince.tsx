              During my internship at Atos, I gained valuable handson experience
              in a professional software development environment. This immersive
              opportunity allowed me to focus on several important aspects:
            </li>
            <li>
              Full-Stack Exposure: I had the chance to work on both front-end
              and back-end components of the project, gaining exposure to the
              entire development process. This experience has solidified my
              understanding of how the different layers of a web application
              interact and collaborate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Practical Application of Skills: Through this internship, I
              practically applied my knowledge of algorithms and data structures
              to solve real-world challenges, showcasing my problem-solving
              abilities and technical acumen.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adaptability and Learning: Working on a live project taught me to
              adapt to changing requirements and learn new technologies
              efficiently. This adaptability is crucial in the ever-evolving
              field of software development.
